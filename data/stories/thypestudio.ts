      "We did achieve some success and garnered the interest of marketing agencies willing to incorporate such marketing strategies for their clients, I also had the opportunity to present our product to local representatives of Slovnaft, discussing the potential inclusion of such games in their marketing campaigns. However, we found that the concept was possibly ahead of its time for the local market, as there was skepticism about embracing innovative ideas, likely due to the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Consequently, we made the decision to redirect our focus towards other endeavors.",
