I began crafting the server-side logic for data handling, and along the way, I encountered a valuable lesson: when working with Next.js, there's no need to create explicit API routes or use methods like getStaticProps. This is because, with the new app directory structure, every component was inherently server-side rendered, although it did take some failed builds to fully grasp.",
