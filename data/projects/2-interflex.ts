      "The project involved creating a bridge between the already existing, mature, and robust software solution from Interflex and the new emerging mobile app. I took part in many architectural meetings with professionals who had extensive knowledge of the products and relevant technology questions. On the Frontend part there was an emphasis on accessibility and offline capabilities, ensuring that state persistence was maintained, even in scenarios where users had poor internet connections, achieved through Redux Persist.",
      "My main role was to implement features by creating new UI elements with React Native, incorporating all essential accessibility features, and connecting them to real data. This also required close collaboration with the backend team to structure the necessary data. Given the complexity of the existing data structures and systems, a weekly meeting was held, where I, as a member of the frontend team, was expected to have a deep understanding of the app's structure and proposed functionalities, primarily referencing detailed Figma files. During these discussions, I provided valuable input when needed. Additionally, I was responsible for providing a weekly presentation of the frontend team's progress to the rest of the team and client representatives.",
